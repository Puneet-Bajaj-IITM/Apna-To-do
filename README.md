# To-Do Web App


This is a simple To-Do web application that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, remove and mark tasks as done from their to-do list. This project was one of my initial projects to practice my web development skills.

## Features

- Add tasks: You can add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Delete tasks: Remove tasks from your to-do list when they are no longer needed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for creating the structure of the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the web page and making it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity to the web app.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Puneet-Bajaj-IITM/Apna-To-do.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run the application.

3. Start adding tasks to your to-do list by typing in the task name and clicking the "Add Task" button.

4. You can mark tasks as done by clicking the checkbox next to the task.

5. To edit a task, simply click on the task name, make your changes, and press Enter to save.

6. To delete a task, click the X can icon next to the task.
